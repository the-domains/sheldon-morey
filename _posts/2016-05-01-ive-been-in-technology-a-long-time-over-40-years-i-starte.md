# About Sheldon

I've been in technology a long time, over 40 years! I started my career as a technologist at ANSTO before the internet and PC's existed. Later my consulting career took me to Europe, USA and SE Asia. For the last 15 years I have manage small business IT infrastructure services.

Understanding technology is complex so small business rely on what they can research. This information is most often inaccurate or not well applied. As a technology professional I can clear up this inconsistency.

A veteran of business from experience gained in hundreds of commercial and public projects. These include Sky TV (UK) customer management to hospital electronic patient records management. I deliver technology solutions applied to business challenges to achieve cost effective services.

I have found that there are 3 main information technology challenges that business face. They don't know how to integrate their requirements and remove duplication. They are unaware of the systems opportunities available to solve their business problems. And they don't know how to use information technology to grow their business.

To solve this problem I provide consulting and project management services. I have developed a framework which maps the business model to the system requirements. My method removes duplication and provides the most strategic, best-fit solution for the business.

Too many businesses are struggling with technology that is not a fit for them. I am on a mission to help those businesses become more efficient. I want businesses to experience information technology as an investment with real financial gains. And use systems which will help them grow their business and increase profitability.

At the end of your Information System Development Strategy program you will have a practical model of your business(s). A prescription to make your technology services and systems in step with your business. A defined measure of 7 critical business areas with an IT competitive measure comparison. A set of projects which will improve your IT competitive value.

Your investment of time into this is, a 2 to 3 hour business model workshop for the key business staff. 1 to 2 hours of staff contact to understand how technology works in the business.

Finally a 2 hour workshop on the results and rank the importance of the future programs.

The benefit to you is you will know which are the key elements which need to be addressed before you move. You will see which technology elements you need to have before, say an acquisition.

You can take the measures outlined in the prescription over as long a period as suits your resources. Or you can engage help to deliver on critical key elements.
